Driven by Data, Powdered by Weather - Racing Performance Amid Variable Conditions
Maritza Beltran

This project is meant to cover a multitude of variables that are out of team and racer control on race day. As an F1 fan, I'm aware that one of the driver's largest responsibiltiies lies in tire preservation/use at the right rate. Currently, there's no real way for a team strategist or engineer to tell you how much life is left in the tire without just looking at it. While this project won't be able to target that specifically, it will provide insight into the correlation between lap times and the track temperature and precipitation during those lap times. There will be a few different focus points for this one:

1. Individual driver performance and what temperatures they most thrive in personally
2. Precipitation and relative humidity during races and who performs best in these conditions. This is important to differenciate from the first point because although a driver might do better than everyone else in certain precipitation or humidity, it is unlikely that they thrive in precipitation instead of a dry track.
